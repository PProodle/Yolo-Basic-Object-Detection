- filterpy
- scikit-image

## Additional Information

The YOLOv5 model from Ultralytics is a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art (SOTA) model designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of object detection, instance segmentation, and image classification tasks.

The OpenCV DNN (Deep Neural Network) module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like Caffe, Torch, and TensorFlow. It also supports popular object detection frameworks like YOLO/DarkNet.

It's important to note that YOLO models are very light and fast, making them a popular choice for real-time object detection, with a high frames-per-second (FPS) rate.

The choice to use YOLO for this project is based on several factors highlighted in research. YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are known for their speed and accuracy, making them popular for object detection tasks. The YOLOv9 model, in particular, achieves a higher mean Average Precision (mAP) than previous versions when benchmarked against the MS COCO dataset, demonstrating its improved performance. Additionally, YOLO models are fast, enabling real-time processing of video feeds at a high FPS rate, which is beneficial for tasks such as live inference on video cameras for object tracking.

Furthermore, YOLO has undergone several iterations, with the latest being YOLOv7, which stands out for its speed and accuracy. Its architecture and trainable bag-of-freebies have been reformed to integrate new features and meet the needs of different inference speeds, contributing to its advancements in accuracy and speed.

Overall, the combination of speed, accuracy, and continuous improvements through iterations and community contributions makes YOLO a compelling choice for object detection tasks, aligning with the requirements of this project.
